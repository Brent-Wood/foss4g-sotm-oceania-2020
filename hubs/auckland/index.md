# Overview

We are excited to present the 2020 FOSS4G SotM Conference Auckland Hub.

With COVID-19 restricting travel, this years FOSS4G-SotM conference is a combined online & physical event. Hubs held around the region will host a mix of shared online content and local presentations. There will be opportunities to meet local OSGeo community attendees and hear from a range of speakers.

This years event will be hosted by NZDF at the Devonport Navy Base, a short walk from the Devonport ferry terminal. Morning tea and lunch will be provided on site.
