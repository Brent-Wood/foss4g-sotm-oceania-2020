<p><b>Title:</b> Ethics in Geo</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> From the Mercator projection to Google Earth, geospatial 
technology has always had an ethical component and a close relationship 
with military and industrial forces. I'll replay the last few decades 
of development in this world, try to figure out where we are and what 
we can do about it.</p>
<p><b>Biography:</b> Tom MacWright spent over a decade in the space of geospatial 
and visualization technology, leading projects at Development Seed, Mapbox, 
and Observable. He's a frequent writer and contributor to open source projects.</p>

<h4>Grayson Cooke</h4>

<p><b>Title:</b>New Uses for Invalid Data: Satellite Imaging and “Path 99”</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b>“Path 99” is an art-science project designed for fulldome 
  planetarium projection. Produced by media artist Grayson Cooke and sound 
  artist Dugal McKinnon, and underpinned by a collaboration with Geoscience 
  Australia and the Digital Earth Australia platform, this project uses 
  satellite images of clouds to explore the weather and landscape of Path 99, 
  an orbit of the Landsat 8 satellite that passes directly down the centre of 
  Australia. In this talk I will provide an “open desktop” outline of the 
  project, focusing on how the project merges GIS applications and processes 
  with artistic and conceptual enquiry.</p>
<p><b>Biography:</b>Born in New Zealand and based in Australia, Grayson Cooke 
  is an interdisciplinary scholar and media artist, Associate Professor of 
  Media at Southern Cross University. Grayson has exhibited and performed at 
  major galleries and festivals internationally including the Japan Media Arts 
  Festival, WRO Media Art Biennale and Imagine Science Film Festival in New 
  York, and he has published widely in academic journals. He holds an 
  interdisciplinary PhD from Concordia University in Montreal.</p>
